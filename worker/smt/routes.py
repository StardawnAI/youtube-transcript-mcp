"""Routes out to the platforms, and the budget each one is spent from.

A route is a way out — `direct`, or `warp` through the Cloudflare WARP proxy.
Budgets are kept per platform *and* route, because that pair is what a
platform sees: one address asking for its pages.

  * one request at a time per pair, with a minimum gap between them
  * a cooldown after a 429, stored in the database, so a restart does not
    forget it and start asking again at once
  * a block after a login challenge, lifted only by a person
  * three network failures in a row cool the pair down for a while — one
    failure says little, three say the route is in trouble

A route that is down is never swapped for another one behind the caller's
back: the job waits and says why. Falling back from WARP to the direct
address silently would spend exactly the address WARP was there to protect.
