"""What went wrong decides what happens next.

A 429 and a deleted video both arrive as "the download failed", and treating
them alike is how a scraper ends up hammering a platform that asked it to
wait, or retrying a video that no longer exists. Each class here carries the
one action that fits it; engine.py carries it out.
